An example of gst-launch that grabs WebCam on the MacOSX :
    gst-launch -m qtkitvideosrc device-index=0 ! \
        video/x-raw-yuv,width=320,height=240,framerate=\(fraction\)30 ! \
            decodebin ! \
            ffmpegcolorspace !\
            glimagesink

An example of gst-launch command that converts source to mp4 format:
    Container: ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, version 2
    Video: H.264
    Audio: AAC

    gst-launch -v \
        videotestsrc num-buffers=1000 ! \
        x264enc pass=5 quantizer=1 speed-preset=6 profile=2 ! \
        mp4mux ! \
        filesink location=videotestsrc.mp4

GStreamer installation
Because Mac OS X Lion is a 64 bit operation system an old Quick time
GStreamer plugin will not longer work. You have to use an QTKit plugin
insteard but by default MacPorts`s gst-bad does not contain a qtkitvideosrc
plugin so in order to grab a webcam video from iSight you will need to compile
gst-bad your self. It could be done in the following way: First of all
you will need to install all gst-* ports using "port install" command.
Then you'll need to download a gst-bad tarball and from the administrative
account executed command: ./configure --prefix=/opt/local && make && make install
If a gstreamer registry does not automatically detect new plugins you will need
to  delte .gstreamer* directory in you home direcotry.

On Microsoft Windows System as a video source a KsVideoSrc plugin should be used.

1. A mode line for vim/gvim/mvim should be:
    # vi:si:et:sw=4:sts=4:ts=4
